# NETINF
Network inference algorithm
File contains 3 major parts:
1. Class Synthetic_Data - it creates cascades of varying size 
2. Class Graph - create prototype for graphs
   Class Cascade - crete prototype for cascades
3. NETINF algorithm - 
   Input - time stamps of various cascades
   Output - graph modelled from underlying data
